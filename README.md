Title: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and Python

Introduction: In this project, I implemented real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 architecture. My goal was to detect objects in both images and video streams efficiently, leveraging the power of deep learning.

Key Components:

YOLOv8: Utilized the YOLOv8 model for object detection due to its balance of accuracy and speed.
Python & Jupyter Notebooks: Employed Python for scripting and Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation.
Image and Video Processing: Integrated video processing with OpenCV to detect objects in motion.
Model Inference: Used pre-trained YOLOv8 weights to perform inference on both image and video data.
Steps:

Dataset Preparation: Gathered and processed data for testing the object detection model.
Model Selection: Chose YOLOv8n for its lightweight architecture suitable for real-time applications.
Inference on Images and Video: Ran detection on a set of test images and a video, demonstrating the modelâ€™s real-time detection capabilities.
Results: Produced outputs that successfully identify and label objects in the given media.
Challenges:

Balancing accuracy and performance.
Handling various object sizes and image qualities.
Conclusion: This project showcased the ability of YOLOv8 to perform real-time object detection with high accuracy, even in video streams. The implementation opens up opportunities for further applications in surveillance, automation, and real-time analytics.
