Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and Python
Introduction
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 architecture. The focus is on efficiently detecting objects in both images and video streams by leveraging deep learning. YOLOv8's lightweight design balances accuracy and performance, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Key Components
YOLOv8: Chosen for its optimized performance and speed, ideal for detecting multiple objects in real time.
Python & Jupyter Notebooks: Utilized for writing scripts, testing, and documenting the results.
OpenCV for Video Processing: Integrated to process video streams and detect moving objects.
Model Inference: YOLOv8 pre-trained weights used for detecting objects in both images and video streams.
Steps
1. Dataset Preparation
I collected a diverse dataset to test the model’s capabilities across multiple object types. Data was preprocessed, resized, and normalized to match YOLOv8 input requirements.

2. Model Selection
I selected the YOLOv8n variant for its lightweight architecture, ideal for real-time object detection on limited resources without sacrificing much accuracy.

3. Inference on Images and Video
The model was tested on both static images and continuous video feeds. Detection was applied frame by frame in videos, and objects were labeled in real time, using the model’s predictions for bounding boxes and class labels.

4. Results
Objects in both images and videos were successfully detected and labeled in real time. The results demonstrate YOLOv8’s ability to detect objects across various lighting conditions, distances, and orientations.

Challenges
Balancing Accuracy and Speed: Adjusting parameters to maintain detection accuracy while ensuring real-time performance.
Handling Object Size Variability: Smaller objects were sometimes missed due to distance or resolution constraints.
Image Quality: Poor lighting or motion blur presented challenges for accurate detection.
Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. With high accuracy and fast processing, this implementation can be extended to various applications, such as surveillance, automation, and real-time video analytics.
